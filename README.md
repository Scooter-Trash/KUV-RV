# KUV-RV
We're making a RV from a KUV (tool) Van with sleeping &amp; bathroom inside. The Kitchen, Pantry, shower, etc will be in the outside tool bins. This is a SCRUM build for placement of items and concepts.  Ultimately EVERYTHING will be dimensioned so materials can be cut in shop and assembed in the vehichle without iterative measure, cut, install, cycles.
